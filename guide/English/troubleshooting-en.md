# Running Windows on the Xiaomi Pad 5

## Troubleshooting Issues


## Device can boot into android but not bootloader

### Prerequisites:

- [ADB & Fastboot](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)

This is caused by partitions with volume names the bootloader cannot handle, to fix this:

- Boot to recovery

- Connect phone to PC

- Open cmd on PC

- Run ```adb shell```

- Run ```parted```

- Run ```print``` to list all partitions

- Look for partitions that have spaces in the names e.g "Basic Data Partition" and note their volume number

- Now run ```rm <vol number>``` e.g ```rm 99```


## fsa4480.sys BSOD on boot

### Prerequisites:

- Open driver folder

- Remove the ```components\QC8150\Device\DEVICE.SOC_QC8150.NABU\Drivers\USB``` folder

- Reinstall the driver

- After it boots, readd the driver and reinstall the driver again
